Predicting TCS stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model is a common task in data science and can provide valuable insights for investors. I'll provide a simplified outline of the steps involved in creating an LSTM model for stock price prediction using historical TCS stock data from 2002 to 2021. Please note that this is a simplified example, and a real-world application would require extensive data preprocessing, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation.

1. Data Collection:

Gather historical TCS stock price data for the period from 2002 to 2021. This data can be obtained from financial databases or APIs such as Yahoo Finance or Quandl.
2. Data Preprocessing:

Clean the data by handling missing values and outliers.
Create a time series dataset with features (e.g., previous stock prices) and the target variable (the next day's stock price).
3. Data Splitting:

Split the dataset into training and testing sets. Typically, 80% for training and 20% for testing is a common split.
4. Feature Scaling:

Normalize or scale the data to ensure that all features are on a similar scale. This is important for the LSTM model to converge effectively.
5. Building the LSTM Model:

Design an LSTM architecture. A simple model might consist of:
An LSTM layer with a specified number of units.
A dropout layer to prevent overfitting.
A fully connected (Dense) output layer.
Compile the model, specifying the loss function (usually mean squared error) and an optimizer (e.g., Adam).
6. Training the Model:

Train the LSTM model on the training data using historical stock prices and their corresponding target prices. Use a suitable batch size and number of epochs. Monitor the loss on the validation data.
7. Model Evaluation:

Evaluate the model's performance on the testing data, using metrics such as mean squared error (MSE) and root mean squared error (RMSE).
8. Prediction and Visualization:

Make predictions on unseen data and compare them to the actual stock prices.
Visualize the predictions alongside the actual stock prices to assess the model's accuracy.
